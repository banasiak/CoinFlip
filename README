Completely FREE (no-ads) and doesn't require any unsafe permissions.

Simply tap the question mark or shake and view the result.  Tap the coin or 
shake to flip again. Spinning coin animation, sound, text, vibration, 
shake-to-flip and coin type are all configurable via the Settings menu.  Verify
the flip algorithm is truly random by running the built-in Self Test and 
flipping the coin 100,000 times while watching the results in real-time.
