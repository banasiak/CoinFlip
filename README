Completely FREE (no-ads) and doesn't require any unsafe permissions. Now supports phones and Android Wear watches!

On your phone: Simply tap the question mark or shake and view the result.  Tap the coin or shake to spin the coin again.
On your watch: Say "Ok, Google. Start Coin Flip." Tap the question mark to spin the coin.

Spinning coin animation, sound, text, vibration, shake-to-flip and coin type are all configurable via the Settings menu.  Verify the flip algorithm is truly random by running the built-in Diagnostic Test and flipping the coin 100,000 times (or more) while watching the results in real-time. (Sorry, no cheating!) Add new coins from Google Play by clicking Settings -> Get More Coins.
